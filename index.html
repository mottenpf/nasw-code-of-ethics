<p>The NASW Code of Ethics is a set of standards that guide the professional conduct of social workers. The 2021 update includes language that addresses the importance of professional self-care. Moreover, revisions to Cultural Competence standard provide more explicit guidance to social workers. All social workers should review the new text and affirm their commitment to abide by the Code of Ethics. Also available in Spanish.

	<div id="dnn_ctr15435_HtmlModule_lblContent"><h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>  The primary mission of the social work profession is to enhance human 
  well-being and help meet the basic human needs of all people, with 
  particular attention to the needs and empowerment of people who are 
  vulnerable, oppressed, and living in poverty. A historic and defining feature 
  of social work is the profession’s dual focus on individual well-being in a 
  social context and the well-being of society. Fundamental to social work is 
  attention to the environmental forces that create, contribute to, and address 
problems in living.
</p>
<p>  Social workers promote social justice and social change with and on 
  behalf of clients. “Clients” is used inclusively to refer to individuals, 
  families, groups, organizations, and communities. Social workers are 
  sensitive to cultural and ethnic diversity and strive to end discrimination, 
  oppression, poverty, and other forms of social injustice. These activities 
  may be in the form of direct practice, community organizing, supervision, 
  consultation, administration, advocacy, social and political action, policy 
  development and implementation, education, and research and evaluation. 
  Social workers seek to enhance the capacity of people to address their own 
  needs. Social workers also seek to promote the responsiveness of 
  organizations, communities, and other social institutions to individuals’ 
needs and social problems.
</p>
<p>  The mission of the social work profession is rooted in a set of core 
  values. These core values, embraced by social workers throughout the 
  profession’s history, are the foundation of social work’s unique purpose 
and perspective:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>   service</li>
	<li>    social justice</li>
	<li> dignity and worth of the person</li>
	<li> importance of human relationships</li>
	<li> integrity</li>
	<li> competence.</li>
</ul>
<p>  This constellation of core values reflects what is unique to the social 
  work profession. Core values, and the principles that flow from them, must 
be balanced within the context and complexity of the human experience.
</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose of the NASW Code of Ethics</h2>
<p>  Professional ethics are at the core of social work. The profession has an 
  obligation to articulate its basic values, ethical principles, and ethical 
  standards. The NASW Code of Ethics sets forth these values, principles, and 
  standards to guide social workers’ conduct. The Code is relevant to all 
  social workers and social work students, regardless of their professional 
functions, the settings in which they work, or the populations they serve.
</p>
<p>  The NASW Code of Ethics serves six purposes:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>The Code identifies core values on which social work’s mission is 
  based.
	
	
	</li>
	<li>The Code summarizes broad ethical principles that reflect the 
  profession’s core values and establishes a set of specific ethical 
  standards that should be used to guide social work practice.

	
	
	</li>
	<li>The Code is designed to help social workers identify relevant 
  considerations when professional obligations conflict or ethical 
  uncertainties arise.

	
	
	</li>
	<li>The Code provides ethical standards to which the general public 
  can hold the social work profession accountable.

	
	
	</li>
	<li>The Code socializes practitioners new to the field to social work’s 
  mission, values, ethical principles, and ethical standards, and encourages 
  all social workers to engage in self-care, ongoing education, and other 
  activities to ensure their commitment to those same core features of 
  the profession.

	
	
	</li>
	<li>The Code articulates standards that the social work profession itself 
  can use to assess whether social workers have engaged in unethical 
  conduct. NASW has formal procedures to adjudicate ethics 
  complaints filed against its members.* In subscribing to this Code, 
  social workers are required to cooperate in its implementation, 
  participate in NASW adjudication proceedings, and abide by any 
NASW disciplinary rulings or sanctions based on it.

	
	
	</li>
</ol>
<p>  The Code offers a set of values, principles, and standards to guide 
  decision making and conduct when ethical issues arise. It does not provide a 
  set of rules that prescribe how social workers should act in all situations. 
  Specific applications of the Code must take into account the context in 
  which it is being considered and the possibility of conflicts among the Code’s 
  values, principles, and standards. Ethical responsibilities flow from all human 
  relationships, from the personal and familial to the social and professional.
</p>
<p>* For information on the NASW Professional Review Process, see NASW Procedures for 
  Professional Review.
</p>
<p>  Furthermore, the NASW Code of Ethics does not specify which values, 
  principles, and standards are most important and ought to outweigh others in 
  instances when they conflict. Reasonable differences of opinion can and do 
  exist among social workers with respect to the ways in which values, ethical 
  principles, and ethical standards should be rank ordered when they conflict. 
  Ethical decision making in a given situation must apply the informed 
  judgment of the individual social worker and should also consider how the 
  issues would be judged in a peer review process where the ethical standards 
of the profession would be applied.
</p>
<p>  Ethical decision making is a process. In situations when conflicting 
  obligations arise, social workers may be faced with complex ethical dilemmas 
  that have no simple answers. Social workers should take into consideration all 
  the values, principles, and standards in this Code that are relevant to any 
  situation in which ethical judgment is warranted. Social workers’ decisions and 
actions should be consistent with the spirit as well as the letter of this Code.
</p>
<p> 
  In addition to this Code, there are many other sources of information about 
  ethical thinking that may be useful. Social workers should consider ethical 
  theory and principles generally, social work theory and research, laws, 
  regulations, agency policies, and other relevant codes of ethics, recognizing 
  that among codes of ethics social workers should consider the NASW Code 
  of Ethics as their primary source. Social workers also should be aware of the 
  impact on ethical decision making of their clients’ and their own personal 
  values and cultural and religious beliefs and practices. They should be aware 
  of any conflicts between personal and professional values and deal with them 
  responsibly. For additional guidance social workers should consult the 
  relevant literature on professional ethics and ethical decision making and seek 
  appropriate consultation when faced with ethical dilemmas. This may involve 
  consultation with an agency-based or social work organization’s ethics 
  committee, a regulatory body, knowledgeable colleagues, supervisors, or 
legal counsel.
</p>
<p> 
  Instances may arise when social workers’ ethical obligations conflict with 
  agency policies or relevant laws or regulations. When such conflicts occur, 
  social workers must make a responsible effort to resolve the conflict in a 
  manner that is consistent with the values, principles, and standards expressed 
  in this Code. If a reasonable resolution of the conflict does not appear possible, 
  social workers should seek proper consultation before making a decision. 
  The NASW Code of Ethics is to be used by NASW and by individuals, 
  agencies, organizations, and bodies (such as licensing and regulatory boards, 
  professional liability insurance providers, courts of law, agency boards of 
  directors, government agencies, and other professional groups) that choose 
  to adopt it or use it as a frame of reference. Violation of standards in this 
  Code does not automatically imply legal liability or violation of the law.
</p>
<p> 
  Such determination can only be made in the context of legal and judicial 
  proceedings. Alleged violations of the Code would be subject to a peer 
  review process. Such processes are generally separate from legal or 
  administrative procedures and insulated from legal review or proceedings to 
allow the profession to counsel and discipline its own members.
</p>
<p> 
  A code of ethics cannot guarantee ethical behavior. Moreover, a code of 
  ethics cannot resolve all ethical issues or disputes or capture the richness 
  and complexity involved in striving to make responsible choices within a 
  moral community. Rather, a code of ethics sets forth values, ethical 
  principles, and ethical standards to which professionals aspire and by which 
  their actions can be judged. Social workers' ethical behavior should result 
  from their personal commitment to engage in ethical practice. The NASW 
  Code of Ethics reflects the commitment of all social workers to uphold the 
  profession’s values and to act ethically. Principles and standards must be 
  applied by individuals of good character who discern moral questions and, 
in good faith, seek to make reliable ethical judgments.
</p>
<p> 
  With growth in the use of communication technology in various aspects 
  of social work practice, social workers need to be aware of the unique 
  challenges that may arise in relation to the maintenance of confidentiality, 
  informed consent, professional boundaries, professional competence, record 
  keeping, and other ethical considerations. In general, all ethical standards in 
  this Code of Ethics are applicable to interactions, relationships, or 
  communications, whether they occur in person or with the use of technology. 
  For the purposes of this Code, “technology-assisted social work services” 
  include any social work services that involve the use of computers, mobile 
  or landline telephones, tablets, video technology, or other electronic or 
  digital technologies; this includes the use of various electronic or digital 
  platforms, such as the Internet, online social media, chat rooms, text 
  messaging, e-mail and emerging digital applications. Technology-assisted 
  social work services encompass all aspects of social work practice, including 
  psychotherapy; individual, family, or group counseling; community 
  organization; administration; advocacy; mediation; education; supervision; 
  research; evaluation; and other social work services. Social workers should 
  keep apprised of emerging technological developments that may be used in 
social work practice and how various ethical standards apply to them.
</p>
<p> 
  Professional self-care is paramount for competent and ethical social 
  work practice. Professional demands, challenging workplace climates, and 
  exposure to trauma warrant that social workers maintain personal and 
  professional health, safety, and integrity. Social work organizations, 
  agencies, and educational institutions are encouraged to promote 
  organizational policies, practices, and materials to support social workers’ 
  self-care.
</p>
<h2 id="principles">Ethical Principles</h2>
<p> 
  The following broad ethical principles are based on social work’s core 
  values of service, social justice, dignity and worth of the person, 
  importance of human relationships, integrity, and competence. These 
  principles set forth ideals to which all social workers should aspire.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Value:</strong> Service  <br>
	<strong>Ethical Principle:</strong> Social workers’ primary goal is to help people in need 
  and to address social problems
</p>
<p> 
  Social workers elevate service to others above self-interest. Social workers 
  draw on their knowledge, values, and skills to help people in need and to 
  address social problems. Social workers are encouraged to volunteer some 
  portion of their professional skills with no expectation of significant 
  financial return (pro bono service).
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Value:</strong> Social Justice <strong><br>
	Ethical Principle: </strong>Social workers challenge social injustice.
</p>
<p> 
  Social workers pursue social change, particularly with and on behalf of 
  vulnerable and oppressed individuals and groups of people. Social 
  workers’ social change efforts are focused primarily on issues of poverty, 
  unemployment, discrimination, and other forms of social injustice. These 
  activities seek to promote sensitivity to and knowledge about oppression 
  and cultural and ethnic diversity. Social workers strive to ensure access to 
  needed information, services, and resources; equality of opportunity; and 
  meaningful participation in decision making for all people.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Value:</strong> Dignity and Worth of the Person <br>
	<strong>Ethical Principle:</strong> Social workers respect the inherent dignity and worth 
of the person.
</p>
<p> 
  Social workers treat each person in a caring and respectful fashion, mindful 
  of individual differences and cultural and ethnic diversity. Social workers 
  promote clients’ socially responsible self-determination. Social workers 
  seek to enhance clients’ capacity and opportunity to change and to address 
  their own needs. Social workers are cognizant of their dual responsibility to 
  clients and to the broader society. They seek to resolve conflicts between 
  clients’ interests and the broader society’s interests in a socially responsible 
  manner consistent with the values, ethical principles, and ethical standards 
  of the profession.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Value:</strong> Importance of Human Relationships <br>
	<strong>  Ethical Principle: </strong>Social workers recognize the central importance of 
human relationships.
</p>
<p> 
  Social workers understand that relationships between and among people are 
  an important vehicle for change. Social workers engage people as partners 
  in the helping process. Social workers seek to strengthen relationships 
  among people in a purposeful effort to promote, restore, maintain, and 
  enhance the well-being of individuals, families, social groups, 
  organizations, and communities.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Value: </strong>Integrity <br>
	<strong>  Ethical Principle:</strong> Social workers behave in a trustworthy manner.
</p>
<p> 
  Social workers are continually aware of the profession’s mission, values, 
  ethical principles, and ethical standards and practice in a manner consistent 
  with them. Social workers should take measures to care for themselves 
  professionally and personally. Social workers act honestly and responsibly 
  and promote ethical practices on the part of the organizations with which 
  they are affiliated.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Value:</strong> Competence <br>
	<strong>  Ethical Principle:</strong> Social workers practice within their areas of competence 
and develop and enhance their professional expertise.
</p>
<p> 
  Social workers continually strive to increase their professional knowledge 
  and skills and to apply them in practice. Social workers should aspire to 
  contribute to the knowledge base of the profession.
</p></div>


<p> 
  The following ethical standards are relevant to the professional activities 
  of all social workers. These standards concern (1) social workers’ 
  ethical responsibilities to clients, (2) social workers’ ethical responsibilities 
  to colleagues, (3) social workers’ ethical responsibilities in practice settings, 
  (4) social workers’ ethical responsibilities as professionals, (5) social 
  workers’ ethical responsibilities to the social work profession, and (6) social 
  workers’ ethical responsibilities to the broader society. 
  Some of the standards that follow are enforceable guidelines for 
  professional conduct, and some are aspirational. The extent to which each 
  standard is enforceable is a matter of professional judgment to be exercised 
  by those responsible for reviewing alleged violations of ethical standards.

	<div id="dnn_ctr53197_HtmlModule_lblContent"><h1 class="nasw_addPading">1. Social Workers' Ethical Responsibilities to Clients</h1>
<p class="lead">NASW Code of Ethics: Ethical Standards
</p>
<h2>1.01 Commitment to Clients  </h2>
<p>Social workers’ primary responsibility is to promote the well-being of 
  clients. In general, clients’ interests are primary. However, social 
  workers’ responsibility to the larger society or specific legal obligations 
  may, on limited occasions, supersede the loyalty owed clients, and 
  clients should be so advised. (Examples include when a social worker 
  is required by law to report that a client has abused a child or has 
  threatened to harm self or others.)
</p>
<h2> 
  1.02 Self-Determination




</h2>
<p> 
  Social workers respect and promote the right of clients to 
  self-determination and assist clients in their efforts to identify and clarify 
  their goals. Social workers may limit clients’ right to self-determination 
  when, in the social workers’ professional judgment, clients’ actions or 
  potential actions pose a serious, foreseeable, and imminent risk to 
  themselves or others.
</p>
<h2> 
  1.03 Informed Consent




</h2>
<p> 
  (a) Social workers should provide services to clients only in the context 
  of a professional relationship based, when appropriate, on valid informed 
  consent. Social workers should use clear and understandable language to 
  inform clients of the purpose of the services, risks related to the services, 
  limits to services because of the requirements of a third-party payer, 
  relevant costs, reasonable alternatives, clients’ right to refuse or 
  withdraw consent, and the time frame covered by the consent. Social 
  workers should provide clients with an opportunity to ask questions.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) In instances when clients are not literate or have difficulty 
  understanding the primary language used in the practice setting, social 
  workers should take steps to ensure clients’ comprehension. This may 
  include providing clients with a detailed verbal explanation or arranging 
  for a qualified interpreter or translator whenever possible.
</p>
<p> 
  (c) In instances when clients lack the capacity to provide informed 
  consent, social workers should protect clients’ interests by seeking 
  permission from an appropriate third party, informing clients consistent 
  with their level of understanding. In such instances social workers should 
  seek to ensure that the third party acts in a manner consistent with 
  clients’ wishes and interests. Social workers should take reasonable steps 
  to enhance such clients’ ability to give informed consent.
</p>
<p> 
  (d) In instances when clients are receiving services involuntarily, social 
  workers should provide information about the nature and extent of 
  services and about the extent of clients’ right to refuse service.
</p>
<p> 
  (e) Social workers should discuss with clients the social workers’ policies 
  concerning the use of technology in the provision of professional services.
</p>
<p> 
  (f) Social workers who use technology to provide social work services 
  should obtain informed consent from the individuals using these services 
  during the initial screening or interview and prior to initiating services. 
  Social workers should assess clients’ capacity to provide informed 
  consent and, when using technology to communicate, verify the identity 
  and location of clients.
</p>
<p> 
  (g) Social workers who use technology to provide social work services 
  should assess the clients’ suitability and capacity for electronic and remote 
  services. Social workers should consider the clients’ intellectual, emotional, 
  and physical ability to use technology to receive services and ability to 
  understand the potential benefits, risks, and limitations of such services. 
  If clients do not wish to use services provided through technology, social 
  workers should help them identify alternate methods of service.
</p>
<p> 
  (h) Social workers should obtain clients’ informed consent before making 
  audio or video recordings of clients or permitting observation of service 
  provision by a third party.
</p>
<p> 
  (i) Social workers should obtain client consent before conducting an 
  electronic search on the client. Exceptions may arise when the search is 
  for purposes of protecting the client or others from serious, foreseeable, 
  and imminent harm, or for other compelling professional reasons.
</p>
<h2> 
  1.04 Competence




</h2>
<p> 
  (a) Social workers should provide services and represent themselves 
  as competent only within the boundaries of their education, training, 
  license, certification, consultation received, supervised experience, or 
  other relevant professional experience.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) Social workers should provide services in substantive areas or use 
  intervention techniques or approaches that are new to them only after 
  engaging in appropriate study, training, consultation, and supervision 
  from people who are competent in those interventions or techniques.
</p>
<p> 
  (c) When generally recognized standards do not exist with respect to an 
  emerging area of practice, social workers should exercise careful judgment 
  and take responsible steps (including appropriate education, research, 
  training, consultation, and supervision) to ensure the competence of their 
  work and to protect clients from harm.
</p>
<p> 
  (d) Social workers who use technology in the provision of social work 
  services should ensure that they have the necessary knowledge and skills to 
  provide such services in a competent manner. This includes an understanding 
  of the special communication challenges when using technology and the 
  ability to implement strategies to address these challenges.
</p>
<p> 
  (e) Social workers who use technology in providing social work services 
  should comply with the laws governing technology and social work 
  practice in the jurisdiction in which they are regulated and located and, 
  as applicable, in the jurisdiction in which the client is located.
</p>
<h2> 
  1.05 Cultural Competence




</h2>
<p> 
  (a) Social workers should demonstrate understanding of culture and its 
  function in human behavior and society, recognizing the strengths that 
  exist in all cultures.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) Social workers should demonstrate knowledge that guides practice with 
  clients of various cultures and be able to demonstrate skills in the provision 
  of culturally informed services that empower marginalized individuals 
  and groups. Social workers must take action against oppression, racism, 
  discrimination, and inequities, and acknowledge personal privilege.
</p>
<p> 
  (c) Social workers should demonstrate awareness and cultural humility 
  by engaging in critical self-reflection (understanding their own bias and 
  engaging in self-correction), recognizing clients as experts of their own 
  culture, committing to lifelong learning, and holding institutions 
  accountable for advancing cultural humility.
</p>
<p> 
  (d) Social workers should obtain education about and demonstrate 
  understanding of the nature of social diversity and oppression with 
  respect to race, ethnicity, national origin, color, sex, sexual orientation, 
  gender identity or expression, age, marital status, political belief, 
  religion, immigration status, and mental or physical ability.
</p>
<p> 
  (e) Social workers who provide electronic social work services should be 
  aware of cultural and socioeconomic differences among clients’ use of 
  and access to electronic technology and seek to prevent such potential 
  barriers. Social workers should assess cultural, environmental, economic, 
  mental or physical ability, linguistic, and other issues that may affect the 
  delivery or use of these services.
</p>
<h2> 
  1.06 Conflicts of Interest




</h2>
<p> 
  (a) Social workers should be alert to and avoid conflicts of interest that 
  interfere with the exercise of professional discretion and impartial 
  judgment. Social workers should inform clients when a real or potential 
  conflict of interest arises and take reasonable steps to resolve the issue in 
  a manner that makes the clients’ interests primary and protects clients’ 
  interests to the greatest extent possible. In some cases, protecting clients’ 
  interests may require termination of the professional relationship with 
  proper referral of the client.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) Social workers should not take unfair advantage of any professional 
  relationship or exploit others to further their personal, religious, political, 
  or business interests.
</p>
<p> 
  (c) Social workers should not engage in dual or multiple relationships with 
  clients or former clients in which there is a risk of exploitation or potential 
  harm to the client. In instances when dual or multiple relationships are 
  unavoidable, social workers should take steps to protect clients and are 
  responsible for setting clear, appropriate, and culturally sensitive 
  boundaries. (Dual or multiple relationships occur when social workers 
  relate to clients in more than one relationship, whether professional, social, 
  or business. Dual or multiple relationships can occur simultaneously or 
  consecutively.)
</p>
<p> 
  (d) When social workers provide services to two or more people who have 
  a relationship with each other (for example, couples, family members), 
  social workers should clarify with all parties which individuals will be 
  considered clients and the nature of social workers’ professional obligations 
  to the various individuals who are receiving services. Social workers 
  who anticipate a conflict of interest among the individuals receiving 
  services or who anticipate having to perform in potentially conflicting 
  roles (for example, when a social worker is asked to testify in a child 
  custody dispute or divorce proceedings involving clients) should clarify 
  their role with the parties involved and take appropriate action to 
  minimize any conflict of interest.
</p>
<p> 
  (e) Social workers should avoid communication with clients using 
  technology (such as social networking sites, online chat, e-mail, text 
  messages, telephone, and video) for personal or non-work-related purposes.
</p>
<p> 
  (f) Social workers should be aware that posting personal information on 
  professional Web sites or other media might cause boundary confusion, 
  inappropriate dual relationships, or harm to clients.
</p>
<p> 
  (g) Social workers should be aware that personal affiliations may increase 
  the likelihood that clients may discover the social worker’s presence on 
  Web sites, social media, and other forms of technology. Social workers 
  should be aware that involvement in electronic communication with 
  groups based on race, ethnicity, language, sexual orientation, gender 
  identity or expression, mental or physical ability, religion, immigration 
  status, and other personal affiliations may affect their ability to work 
  effectively with particular clients.
</p>
<p> 
  (h) Social workers should avoid accepting requests from or engaging in 
  personal relationships with clients on social networking sites or other 
  electronic media to prevent boundary confusion, inappropriate dual 
  relationships, or harm to clients.
</p>
<h2> 
  1.07 Privacy and Confidentiality




</h2>
<p> 
  (a) Social workers should respect clients’ right to privacy. Social workers 
  should not solicit private information from or about clients except for 
  compelling professional reasons. Once private information is shared, 
  standards of confidentiality apply.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) Social workers may disclose confidential information when appropriate 
  with valid consent from a client or a person legally authorized to consent 
  on behalf of a client.
</p>
<p> 
  (c) Social workers should protect the confidentiality of all information 
  obtained in the course of professional service, except for compelling 
  professional reasons. The general expectation that social workers will keep 
  information confidential does not apply when disclosure is necessary to 
  prevent serious, foreseeable, and imminent harm to a client or others. In 
  all instances, social workers should disclose the least amount of confidential 
  information necessary to achieve the desired purpose; only information 
  that is directly relevant to the purpose for which the disclosure is made 
  should be revealed.
</p>
<p> 
  (d) If social workers plan to disclose confidential information, they 
  should (when feasible and to the extent possible) inform clients about 
  the disclosure and the potential consequences prior to disclosing the 
  information. This applies whether social workers disclose confidential 
  information on the basis of a legal requirement or client consent.
</p>
<p> 
  (e) Social workers should discuss with clients and other interested 
  parties the nature of confidentiality and limitations of clients’ right to 
  confidentiality. Social workers should review with clients circumstances 
  where confidential information may be requested and where disclosure 
  of confidential information may be legally required. This discussion 
  should occur as soon as possible in the social worker–client relationship 
  and as needed throughout the course of the relationship.
</p>
<p> 
  (f) When social workers provide counseling services to families, couples, 
  or groups, social workers should seek agreement among the parties involved 
  concerning each individual’s right to confidentiality and obligation to 
  preserve the confidentiality of information shared by others. This agreement 
  should include consideration of whether confidential information may be 
  exchanged in person or electronically, among clients or with others 
  outside of formal counseling sessions. Social workers should inform 
  participants in family, couples, or group counseling that social workers 
  cannot guarantee that all participants will honor such agreements.
</p>
<p> 
  (g) Social workers should inform clients involved in family, couples, 
  marital, or group counseling of the social worker’s, employer’s, and 
  agency’s policy concerning the social worker’s disclosure of confidential 
  information among the parties involved in the counseling.
</p>
<p> 
  (h) Social workers should not disclose confidential information to 
  third-party payers unless clients have authorized such disclosure.
</p>
<p> 
  (i) Social workers should not discuss confidential information, electronically 
  or in person, in any setting unless privacy can be ensured. Social workers 
  should not discuss confidential information in public or semipublic areas 
  such as hallways, waiting rooms, elevators, and restaurants.
</p>
<p> 
  (j) Social workers should protect the confidentiality of clients during legal 
  proceedings to the extent permitted by law. When a court of law or other 
  legally authorized body orders social workers to disclose confidential or 
  privileged information without a client’s consent and such disclosure 
  could cause harm to the client, social workers should request that the 
  court withdraw the order or limit the order as narrowly as possible or 
  maintain the records under seal, unavailable for public inspection.
</p>
<p> 
  (k) Social workers should protect the confidentiality of clients when 
  responding to requests from members of the media.
</p>
<p> 
  (l) Social workers should protect the confidentiality of clients’ written 
  and electronic records and other sensitive information. Social workers 
  should take reasonable steps to ensure that clients’ records are stored in a 
  secure location and that clients’ records are not available to others who 
  are not authorized to have access.
</p>
<p> 
  (m) Social workers should take reasonable steps to protect the 
  confidentiality of electronic communications, including information 
  provided to clients or third parties. Social workers should use applicable 
  safeguards (such as encryption, firewalls, and passwords) when using 
  electronic communications such as e-mail, online posts, online chat 
  sessions, mobile communication, and text messages.
</p>
<p> 
  (n) Social workers should develop and disclose policies and procedures 
  for notifying clients of any breach of confidential information in a 
  timely manner.
</p>
<p> 
  (o) In the event of unauthorized access to client records or information, 
  including any unauthorized access to the social worker’s electronic 
  communication or storage systems, social workers should inform clients of 
  such disclosures, consistent with applicable laws and professional standards.
</p>
<p> 
  (p) Social workers should develop and inform clients about their policies, 
  consistent with prevailing social work ethical standards, on the use of 
  electronic technology, including Internet-based search engines, to gather 
  information about clients.
</p>
<p> 
  (q) Social workers should avoid searching or gathering client information 
  electronically unless there are compelling professional reasons, and when 
  appropriate, with the client’s informed consent.
</p>
<p> 
  (r) Social workers should avoid posting any identifying or confidential 
  information about clients on professional Web sites or other forms of 
  social media.
</p>
<p> 
  (s) Social workers should transfer or dispose of clients’ records in a 
  manner that protects clients’ confidentiality and is consistent with 
  applicable laws governing records and social work licensure.
</p>
<p> 
  (t) Social workers should take reasonable precautions to protect client 
  confidentiality in the event of the social worker’s termination of practice, 
  incapacitation, or death.
</p>
<p> 
  (u) Social workers should not disclose identifying information when 
  discussing clients for teaching or training purposes unless the client has 
  consented to disclosure of confidential information.
</p>
<p> 
  (v) Social workers should not disclose identifying information when 
  discussing clients with consultants unless the client has consented to 
  disclosure of confidential information or there is a compelling need for 
  such disclosure.
</p>
<p> 
  (w) Social workers should protect the confidentiality of deceased clients 
  consistent with the preceding standards.
</p>
<h2> 
  1.08 Access to Records




</h2>
<p> 
  (a) Social workers should provide clients with reasonable access to 
  records concerning the client. Social workers who are concerned that 
  clients’ access to their records could cause serious misunderstanding or 
  harm to the client should provide assistance in interpreting the records 
  and consultation with the client regarding the records. Social workers 
  should limit clients’ access to their records, or portions of their records, 
  only in exceptional circumstances when there is compelling evidence 
  that such access would cause serious harm to the client. Both clients’ 
  requests and the rationale for withholding some or all of the record 
  should be documented in clients’ files.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) Social workers should develop and inform clients about their policies, 
  consistent with prevailing social work ethical standards, on the use of 
  technology to provide clients with access to their records.
</p>
<p> 
  (c) When providing clients with access to their records, social workers 
  should take steps to protect the confidentiality of other individuals 
  identified or discussed in such records.
</p>
<h2> 
  1.09 Sexual Relationships




</h2>
<p> 
  (a) Social workers should under no circumstances engage in sexual 
  activities, inappropriate sexual communications through the use of 
  technology or in person, or sexual contact with current clients, whether 
  such contact is consensual or forced.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) Social workers should not engage in sexual activities or sexual 
  contact with clients’ relatives or other individuals with whom clients 
  maintain a close personal relationship when there is a risk of exploitation 
  or potential harm to the client. Sexual activity or sexual contact with 
  clients’ relatives or other individuals with whom clients maintain a 
  personal relationship has the potential to be harmful to the client and 
  may make it difficult for the social worker and client to maintain 
  appropriate professional boundaries. Social workers—not their clients, 
  their clients’ relatives, or other individuals with whom the client 
  maintains a personal relationship—assume the full burden for setting 
  clear, appropriate, and culturally sensitive boundaries.
</p>
<p> 
  (c) Social workers should not engage in sexual activities or sexual 
  contact with former clients because of the potential for harm to the 
  client. If social workers engage in conduct contrary to this prohibition 
  or claim that an exception to this prohibition is warranted because of 
  extraordinary circumstances, it is social workers—not their clients—who 
  assume the full burden of demonstrating that the former client has not 
  been exploited, coerced, or manipulated, intentionally or unintentionally.
</p>
<p> 
  (d) Social workers should not provide clinical services to individuals 
  with whom they have had a prior sexual relationship. Providing clinical 
  services to a former sexual partner has the potential to be harmful to the 
  individual and is likely to make it difficult for the social worker and 
  individual to maintain appropriate professional boundaries.
</p>
<h2> 
  1.10 Physical Contact




</h2>
<p> 
  Social workers should not engage in physical contact with clients when 
  there is a possibility of psychological harm to the client as a result of the 
  contact (such as cradling or caressing clients). Social workers who 
  engage in appropriate physical contact with clients are responsible for 
  setting clear, appropriate, and culturally sensitive boundaries that govern 
  such physical contact.
</p>
<h2> 
  1.11 Sexual Harassment




</h2>
<p> 
  Social workers should not sexually harass clients. Sexual harassment 
  includes sexual advances; sexual solicitation; requests for sexual favors; 
  and other verbal, written, electronic, or physical contact of a sexual nature.
</p>
<h2>1.12 Derogatory Language</h2>
<p> 
  Social workers should not use derogatory language in their written, verbal, 
  or electronic communications to or about clients. Social workers should use 
  accurate and respectful language in all communications to and about clients.
</p>
<h2> 
  1.13 Payment for Services




</h2>
<p> 
  (a) When setting fees, social workers should ensure that the fees are fair, 
  reasonable, and commensurate with the services performed. Consideration 
  should be given to clients’ ability to pay.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) Social workers should avoid accepting goods or services from clients 
  as payment for professional services. Bartering arrangements, particularly 
  involving services, create the potential for conflicts of interest,  
  exploitation, and inappropriate boundaries in social workers’ relationships 
  with clients. Social workers should explore and may participate in 
  bartering only in very limited circumstances when it can be demonstrated 
  that such arrangements are an accepted practice among professionals in 
  the local community, considered to be essential for the provision of 
  services, negotiated without coercion, and entered into at the client’s 
  initiative and with the client’s informed consent. Social workers who 
  accept goods or services from clients as payment for professional 
  services assume the full burden of demonstrating that this arrangement 
  will not be detrimental to the client or the professional relationship.
</p>
<p> 
  (c) Social workers should not solicit a private fee or other remuneration 
  for providing services to clients who are entitled to such available 
  services through the social workers’ employer or agency.
</p>
<h2> 
  1.14 Clients Who Lack Decision-Making Capacity




</h2>
<p> 
  When social workers act on behalf of clients who lack the capacity to 
  make informed decisions, social workers should take reasonable steps to 
  safeguard the interests and rights of those clients.
</p>
<h2> 
  1.15 Interruption of Services




</h2>
<p> 
  Social workers should make reasonable efforts to ensure continuity of 
  services in the event that services are interrupted by factors such as 
  unavailability, disruptions in electronic communication, relocation, 
  illness, mental or physical ability, or death.
</p>
<h2> 
  1.16 Referral for Services




</h2>
<p> 
  (a) Social workers should refer clients to other professionals when the 
  other professionals’ specialized knowledge or expertise is needed to serve 
  clients fully or when social workers believe that they are not being 
  effective or making reasonable progress with clients and that other 
  services are required.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) Social workers who refer clients to other professionals should take 
  appropriate steps to facilitate an orderly transfer of responsibility. Social 
  workers who refer clients to other professionals should disclose, with 
  clients’ consent, all pertinent information to the new service providers.
</p>
<p> 
  (c) Social workers are prohibited from giving or receiving payment for a 
  referral when no professional service is provided by the referring social 
  worker.
</p>
<h2> 
  1.17 Termination of Services




</h2>
<p> 
  (a) Social workers should terminate services to clients and professional 
  relationships with them when such services and relationships are no 
  longer required or no longer serve the clients’ needs or interests.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) Social workers should take reasonable steps to avoid abandoning 
  clients who are still in need of services. Social workers should withdraw 
  services precipitously only under unusual circumstances, giving careful 
  consideration to all factors in the situation and taking care to minimize 
  possible adverse effects. Social workers should assist in making 
  appropriate arrangements for continuation of services when necessary.
</p>
<p> 
  (c) Social workers in fee-for-service settings may terminate services to 
  clients who are not paying an overdue balance if the financial contractual 
  arrangements have been made clear to the client, if the client does not 
  pose an imminent danger to self or others, and if the clinical and other 
  consequences of the current nonpayment have been addressed and 
  discussed with the client.
</p>
<p> 
  (d) Social workers should not terminate services to pursue a social, 
  financial, or sexual relationship with a client.
</p>
<p> 
  (e) Social workers who anticipate the termination or interruption of services 
  to clients should notify clients promptly and seek the transfer, referral, or 
  continuation of services in relation to the clients’ needs and preferences.
</p>
<p> 
  (f) Social workers who are leaving an employment setting should inform 
  clients of appropriate options for the continuation of services and of the 
  benefits and risks of the options.

<p class="lead">NASW Code of Ethics: Ethical Standards
</p>
<h2>2.01 Respect</h2>
<p> 
  (a) Social workers should treat colleagues with respect and should 
  represent accurately and fairly the qualifications, views, and obligations 
  of colleagues.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) Social workers should avoid unwarranted negative criticism of 
  colleagues in verbal, written, and electronic communications with clients 
  or with other professionals. Unwarranted negative criticism may include 
  demeaning comments that refer to colleagues’ level of competence or to 
  individuals’ attributes such as race, ethnicity, national origin, color, sex, 
  sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, 
  political belief, religion, immigration status, and mental or physical ability.
</p>
<p> 
  (c) Social workers should cooperate with social work colleagues and 
  with colleagues of other professions when such cooperation serves the 
  well-being of clients.
</p>
<h2> 
  2.02 Confidentiality


</h2>
<p> 
  Social workers should respect confidential information shared by 
  colleagues in the course of their professional relationships and 
  transactions. Social workers should ensure that such colleagues 
  understand social workers’ obligation to respect confidentiality and 
  any exceptions related to it.
</p>
<h3> 
  2.03 Interdisciplinary Collaboration


</h3>
<p> 
  (a) Social workers who are members of an interdisciplinary team should 
  participate in and contribute to decisions that affect the well-being of 
  clients by drawing on the perspectives, values, and experiences of the 
  social work profession. Professional and ethical obligations of the 
  interdisciplinary team as a whole and of its individual members should 
  be clearly established.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) Social workers for whom a team decision raises ethical concerns 
  should attempt to resolve the disagreement through appropriate channels. 
  If the disagreement cannot be resolved, social workers should pursue 
  other avenues to address their concerns consistent with client well-being.
</p>
<h2> 
  2.04 Disputes Involving Colleagues


</h2>
<p> 
  (a) Social workers should not take advantage of a dispute between a 
  colleague and an employer to obtain a position or otherwise advance 
  the social workers’ own interests.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) Social workers should not exploit clients in disputes with colleagues 
  or engage clients in any inappropriate discussion of conflicts between 
  social workers and their colleagues.
</p>
<h2> 
  2.05 Consultation


</h2>
<p> 
  (a) Social workers should seek the advice and counsel of colleagues 
  whenever such consultation is in the best interests of clients.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) Social workers should keep themselves informed about colleagues’ 
  areas of expertise and competencies. Social workers should seek 
  consultation only from colleagues who have demonstrated knowledge, 
  expertise, and competence related to the subject of the consultation.
</p>
<p> 
  (c) When consulting with colleagues about clients, social workers should 
  disclose the least amount of information necessary to achieve the purposes 
  of the consultation.
</p>
<h2> 
  2.06 Sexual Relationships


</h2>
<p> 
  (a) Social workers who function as supervisors or educators should not 
  engage in sexual activities or contact (including verbal, written, 
  electronic, or physical contact) with supervisees, students, trainees, or 
  other colleagues over whom they exercise professional authority.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) Social workers should avoid engaging in sexual relationships with 
  colleagues when there is potential for a conflict of interest. Social 
  workers who become involved in, or anticipate becoming involved in, a 
  sexual relationship with a colleague have a duty to transfer professional 
  responsibilities, when necessary, to avoid a conflict of interest.
</p>
<h2> 
  2.07 Sexual Harassment


</h2>
<p> 
  Social workers should not sexually harass supervisees, students, trainees, 
  or colleagues. Sexual harassment includes sexual advances; sexual 
  solicitation; requests for sexual favors; and other verbal, written, 
  electronic, or physical contact of a sexual nature.
</p>
<h2> 
  2.08 Impairment of Colleagues


</h2>
<p> 
  (a) Social workers who have direct knowledge of a social work colleague’s 
  impairment that is due to personal problems, psychosocial distress, 
  substance abuse, or mental health difficulties and that interferes with 
  practice effectiveness should consult with that colleague when feasible 
  and assist the colleague in taking remedial action.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) Social workers who believe that a social work colleague’s impairment 
  interferes with practice effectiveness and that the colleague has not taken 
  adequate steps to address the impairment should take action through 
  appropriate channels established by employers, agencies, NASW, 
  licensing and regulatory bodies, and other professional organizations.
</p>
<h2> 
  2.09 Incompetence of Colleagues


</h2>
<p> 
  (a) Social workers who have direct knowledge of a social work 
  colleague’s incompetence should consult with that colleague when 
  feasible and assist the colleague in taking remedial action.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) Social workers who believe that a social work colleague is incompetent 
  and has not taken adequate steps to address the incompetence should 
  take action through appropriate channels established by employers, 
  agencies, NASW, licensing and regulatory bodies, and other professional 
  organizations.
</p>
<h2> 
  2.10 Unethical Conduct of Colleagues


</h2>
<p> 
  (a) Social workers should take adequate measures to discourage, prevent, 
  expose, and correct the unethical conduct of colleagues, including 
  unethical conduct using technology.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) Social workers should be knowledgeable about established policies 
  and procedures for handling concerns about colleagues’ unethical 
  behavior. Social workers should be familiar with national, state, and 
  local procedures for handling ethics complaints. These include policies 
  and procedures created by NASW, licensing and regulatory bodies, 
  employers, agencies, and other professional organizations.
</p>
<p> 
  (c) Social workers who believe that a colleague has acted unethically 
  should seek resolution by discussing their concerns with the colleague 
  when feasible and when such discussion is likely to be productive.
</p>
<p> 
  (d) When necessary, social workers who believe that a colleague has acted 
  unethically should take action through appropriate formal channels (such 
  as contacting a state licensing board or regulatory body, the NASW 
  National Ethics Committee, or other professional ethics committees).
</p>
<p> 
  (e) Social workers should defend and assist colleagues who are unjustly 
  charged with unethical conduct.

<h2>4.01 Competence</h2>
<p> 
  (a) Social workers should accept responsibility or employment only 
  on the basis of existing competence or the intention to acquire the 
necessary competence.
</p>
<p> 
  (b) Social workers should strive to become and remain proficient in 
  professional practice and the performance of professional functions. 
  Social workers should critically examine and keep current with emerging 
  knowledge relevant to social work. Social workers should routinely 
  review the professional literature and participate in continuing education 
relevant to social work practice and social work ethics.
</p>
<p> 
  (c) Social workers should base practice on recognized knowledge, 
  including empirically based knowledge, relevant to social work and 
social work ethics.
</p>
<h2>

<p> 
  Social workers should not practice, condone, facilitate, or collaborate 
  with any form of discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, national
